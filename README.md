Image segmentation with U-net
This project makes use of U-Net for:

    -Building an own U-Net, a type of CNN designed for quick, precise image segmentation, and using it to predict a label for every single pixel in an image - in this case, an image from a self-driving car dataset.
    -Explaining the difference between a regular CNN and a U-net.
    -Implemention of semantic image segmentation on the CARLA self-driving car dataset
